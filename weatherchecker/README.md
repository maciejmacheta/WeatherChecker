# Project Name

Briefly describe your project here. A couple of sentences explaining what the project does and its purpose.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```bash
node -v // Check if Node.js is installed
npm -v // Check if npm is installed
```

If you don't have Node.js and npm installed, follow the instructions here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of commands that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maciejmacheta/WeatherChecker.git
cd WeatherChecker
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies, including React.js and Tailwind CSS.

3. **Setting up Tailwind CSS**

Ensure that Tailwind CSS is set up properly by checking if the `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files exist and are configured correctly. If not, you can set up Tailwind CSS by running:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

This command will create the `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files with default configurations.

4. **Start the development server**

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the project in your default browser. By default, the project will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system (if applicable).

```bash
npm test
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system (if applicable).

## Built With
